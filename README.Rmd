# seedr

## Overview

seedr is an R package that provides functions to process data generated in laboratory germination experiments, fitting hydrothermal time germination models. These models allow to characterize seed lots by parameters that indicate the physiological thresholds (of temperature or water) between which the seed lot can germinate, and the physiological-time units that the seeds in the seed lot need to accumulate before they can germinate.
